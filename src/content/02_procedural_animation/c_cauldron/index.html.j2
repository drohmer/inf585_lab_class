::[color:gray;]
__Path of the scene: [01_procedural/b_billboards]__

::[height:25px;]::

This code display a scene in loading some external .obj meshes: A cauldron and a spoon
* __Note: The meshes files are stored in the directory assets/. This directory should be accessible from the place where your executable is run.__

::[height:25px;]::

A set of particles (one displayed as sphere, and the other using a semi-transparent textured mapped onto a quad) are emited regularily. <br>
> **Modify the code to model a scene similar to the following one**.

::[height:25px;]::

* __Tips__

** - When dealing with the billboards, you may debug your trajectory in displaying a sphere instead of the semi-transparent texture.
** - The billboards should always face the camera.
** - The uniform value __material.alpha__ can send an alpha value to the shader to model a global time varying transparency level.
